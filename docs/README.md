# comprs Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **comprs**, a minimal-dependency, high-performance image compression library written in Rust.

This documentation is designed to be accessible to developers who may not be familiar with the low-level details of image compression. We use clear explanations, visual examples, and step-by-step breakdowns to help you understand not just *how* these algorithms work, but *why* they work.

## 💡 Philosophy

> *"The best way to understand compression is to understand that all data has patterns, and compression is simply the art of describing those patterns more efficiently."*

Every algorithm in this library exploits some form of redundancy:

| Algorithm | Type of Redundancy Exploited |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Huffman Coding | Statistical redundancy (some symbols occur more often) |
| LZ77 | Spatial redundancy (patterns repeat in data) |
| PNG Filtering | Predictive redundancy (adjacent pixels are similar) |
| DCT | Frequency redundancy (images have few high-frequency components) |
| Quantization | Perceptual redundancy (humans can't see small changes) |

Understanding these principles will help you reason about when and why each algorithm is effective.

Beyond correctness, performance matters. See [Performance Optimization](./performance-optimization.md) for how we make these algorithms fast through techniques like SIMD, lookup tables, and algorithm selection.
