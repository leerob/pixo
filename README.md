# comprs

A minimal-dependency, high-performance image compression library written in Rust.

This is a work-in-progress and exploration of coding agents.

## Features

- **Zero runtime dependencies** — All encoding algorithms implemented from scratch
- **Entirely in Rust** — No C or C++ codecs required
- **PNG and JPEG support** — Lossless PNG, lossy PNG (quantization), and lossy JPEG
- **Small WASM binary** — 142 KB with competitive compression ([benchmarks](./benches/BENCHMARKS.md))
- **Well-tested** — 76% code coverage, 264 tests ([codebase comparison](./docs/codebase-size-comparison.md))

## Usage

1. **[Playground](https://comprs.vercel.app/)** (recommended) — Try it in your browser
2. **[WASM](./docs/wasm.md)** — Use in browser or Node.js applications
3. **[CLI](./docs/cli.md)** — Compress images from the command line
4. **[Rust Crate](./docs/crate.md)** — Use as a library in your Rust projects
